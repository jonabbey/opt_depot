<H3><A NAME="heck"></A>What the heck is an opt_depot?</H3>

<P>Opt_depot is a suite of perl scripts that several folks here at Applied
Research Laboratroies have spent many grueling yet loving hours working
on. The result is a tool that makes systems administration tasks involving
software installation, de-installation, testing and maintence substantially
easier to perform. Once the general workings of opt_depot are understood,
the program is simple to run and it creates an enviornment that makes it's
own workings invisable to the general user.</P>

<P>The basic idea behind opt_depot has been implemented successfully in
many other guises, most notably in <A HREF="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/ANDREWII/depot.html">Carnagie
Mellon's Depot Software</A>. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="pack"></A>What is a software package?</H3>

<P>Software is installed in the form of a <I>package</I>, meaning that
the software's component files are placed into sub-directories based on
their content -- executables are placed into the package's /bin sub-directory,
library routines are placed in /lib, and man page information is placed
in /man. There are also /include and /info sub-directories as well. So
something like emacs-19.33 would consist of a main directory (e.g. emacs-19.33),
under which its own /bin/lin/info/include/man sub-directories would be
placed.</P>

<P>To learn more about installing software for use with opt_depot, check
out the <A HREF="installing_packages.html">software installation page</A>.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="need"></A>What does opt_depot need to run?</H3>

<P>Make sure that you have a version of perl 5.0 or above installed on
your system. Opt_depot 2.0 takes advantage of many perl 5 features, and
it won't be able to run with earlier versions of perl.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="access"></A>How do I access an earlier version of an installed
software package?</H3>

<P>When installing new software, packages should be compiled so that they
expect to find their files under the <A HREF="http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/~butcher/docs/2.0glossary.html#depot">depot</A>
directory (ie &quot;/usr/local&quot;, &quot;/opt/depot&quot;, etc). That
means that if a new version excludes an older one (by listing the old version
in a <B><I>.exclude</I></B> file), then the old version will not be linked
into the depot directory by <I>opt_link </I>and subsequently won't be able
to run properly.</P>

<P>So if somone using the network is really infatuated with emacs-19.30,
and doesn't like the newer, fancier versions. There is a way to allow this
early version to co-exist with other versions in the depot directory, without
being designated as the default that is invoked when joe-average user types
in &quot;<TT>emacs</TT>&quot;. </P>

<P>The trick here is to allow the older vdersion to be linked into the
depot directory, but to exclude all the links to /bin/lib/info/include/man
that would normally be built. So if you wanted to have emacs-19.30 able
to be accessed through depot, but didn't want it to be the version that
everyone uses by default, add the following lines to the <B><I>.exclude
</I></B>file:</P>

<PRE>
emacs-19.30/bin
emacs-19.30/lib
emacs-19.30/man
emacs-19.30/info
emacs-19.30/include

</PRE>

<P>That way, a program like emacs-19.30 can be run by the user who doesn't
want to change with the times.</P>

<H3><A NAME="customize"></A>How can I customize my client?</H3>

<P>If opt_depot is installed on the network server, then opt_depot's default
behavior is to use the 'sites' and configuration files located in the etc/
directory of the opt_depot package itself (i.e. files located on the server).
But if a certain client wishes to adopt different variables for the directory
names, or add local package archives to the sites file, then copies of
the sites and configuration files must be made <I>to the Software Base
directory that is listed in the servrer's configuration file </I>These
local copies will override the server's copies.</P>

<P>As an example, suppose that the Software Base directory was listed as
<I>/opt</I> in the <I>server's </I>configuration file. When the opt_depot
scripts are run on the client, they will check to see if a file called
<I>/opt/opt.config </I>exists (additionally, opt_link will look for <I>/opt/sites</I>).
If<I> /opt/opt.config </I>was there, then variables specified in this local
copy would be the ones that the opt_depot scripts use at runtime.</P>

<H3><A NAME="op_sys"></A>How do I organize packages by operating system?</H3>

<P>A good way to organize software is by creating sub-directories under
/bin, /lib et al. for each operating system. For example, there might be
<I>/bin/winNT_bin </I>and /<I>bin/SunOS5.5_bin </I>under the /bin directory
of the software base. The advantage to doing this is that you insure every
package that is found under a given operating system sub-directory is compiled
to run on that particular operating system, and all the different flavors
of a pakcges (for each seperate operating system) are still located under
a single package heading.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3><A NAME="-r"></A>What does the -r option for opt_depot and opt_clean
do?</H3>

<P>The -r command line option that is used with opt_depot and opt_clean
enables a feature known as recursive directory unification. If file conflicts
occur during the linking process, opt_depot will check to see if it is
worthwhile to make sub-directories under the software base directory, so
that instead of having a single link to one package this subdirectory can
contain links to files in both packages.</P>

<P>Opt_clean has also been modified so that when -r is used, it will remove
empty subdirectories under the software base that have been created by
opt_depot and are now empty, and will remove those directories that contain
links to a single package and replace it with a single symbolic link to
that package.</P>

<P>The main reason we included this feature was to unify the 'include'
directories of packages like X11R5 and X11R6. But during testing we found
that some directories were created that we really didn't want, and some
directories were removed by opt_clean that needed to remain in place (even
though they were empty at the time).</P>

<P><I>To deal with these problems, two steps were taken</I>:</P>

<P>First, opt_depot explicitly states which directories are candidates
for unification through the use of an array called path_list. If the list
contained only &quot;include/&quot;, then only subdirectories of &quot;include/&quot;
will be able to be unified. The path_list variable is listed under the
&quot;defaults&quot; section of the opt_depot source code.</P>

<P>Second, any time opt_depot creates a unifying subdirectory, it leaves
a file behind to indicate that the directory was created by opt_depot and
not by some other party. Opt_clean will only remove directories that contain
this file, and will leave any other directories in place even if they contain
no files.</P>
