<P>This document is intended to help guide the systems administrator though
the process of installing opt_depot using the setup shell script included
with the opt_depot software package.<FONT SIZE=+1> </FONT></P>

<H3>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H3>

<H3>Types of Installation</H3>

<P>The first thing to do is figure out what type of configuration you want
for opt_depot, depending on the functions you would like it to perform.
<I>There are 3 types of installations</I>:</P>

<LI><B>Client-side Installation Only<I> (no network access) </I></B></LI>

<UL>
<P><B><I>Example</I></B>: using opt_depot with a home Linux system.</P>

<P><I>Advantages</I>: Allows clean and simple management of software packages
in a non-networked UNIX environment.</P>

<P><I>Configuration Issues</I>: Because there is no common network involved,
running opt_link is unnecessary. Also, there is no need to put the line
to run opt_setup into chron; simply run opt setup when installing any new
software packages</P>
</UL>

<LI><B>Client-side Installation with Network Access</B></LI>

<UL>
<P><B><I>Example</I>:</B> In a networked system the opt_depot scripts are
physically installed on each individual client, as opposed to having them
installed on the server.</P>

<P><I>Advantages</I>: This setup allows the greatest customizability among
clients with respect to directory and file names.</P>

<P><I>Disadvantages</I>:&nbsp;Maintaining the opt_depot scripts is more
difficult, since each client has its own copy of the opt_depot software
to maintain and update.</P>

<P><I>Configuration Issues:</I> Since each client has a copy of opt_depot,
separate configuration files will reside on each client as well. These
files contain the directory information necessary to run the opt_depot
scripts, and may vary from client to client.</P>
</UL>

<LI><B>Shared Network Installation</B></LI>

<OL>
<P><B><I>Example</I></B>: The opt_depot package is installed on the server,
allowing all clients access to a shared copy of the program.</P>

<P><I>Advantages</I>: see <B>client-side with network</B> disadvantages.
Only the server's copy of opt_depot must maintained, and any client systems
using opt-depot will possess the same directory structure with respect
to the <A HREF="2.0glossary.html#depot">depot</A>, <A HREF="2.0glossary.html#base">software
base </A>and log directories. However, each client may still have its own
individual <A HREF="opt_link2.0.html">'sites'</A> file indicating the package
archives for that particular client system.</P>

<P><I>Disadvantages</I>: see <B>client-side with network </B>advantages.
Directory and filenames must be constant across all clients. For example,
if the depot directory is specified as &quot;/opt/depot&quot;, then all
clients must use it as the designated depot directory.</P>

<P><I>Configuration Issues</I>: Sharing a copy of the opt_depot located
on the server also entails sharing a common configuration file, meaning
that all directory and filenames used by opt_depot must be constant across
the client systems.</P>
</OL>

<P>Here at Applied Research Laboratories we prefer to use the shared network
installation, since it's is less of a hassle to maintain the opt_depot
scripts. Thus far we have had no problems stemming from the use of consist
ant directory names across our clients, and in fact this type of installation
seems to make managing opt_depot a simpler task all around.</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H3>Running setup.sh</H3>

<P><I>Step One: Finding Perl</I></P>

<UL>
<P>When the setup program is executed, the first thing it does is search
for any versions of perl that may be on the system. If it finds either
the 'perl' or 'perl5' command, it will return the directory where it was
located. </P>

<P>If perl is not found at all , or if the administrator doesn't want to
use the perl version that was found, then setup.sh will prompt the administrator
for the absolute pathname of the perl executable.</P>

<P>It's important to remember that opt_depot needs perl 5,0 or above in
order to function properly. In addition, the particular location of perl
specified by the administrator during setup will be added to opt_depot
during the copying process (<I>step six) </I>in the form of a <B>#! </B>line
placed at the beginning of each opt_depot script.</P>
</UL>

<P><I>Step Two: Entering the Software Base directory</I></P>

<UL>
<P>Once the first step of the installation process has been completed,
setup.sh will then ask the administrator to enter the software base directory.
This directory is where the /<I>bin/lib/man/include/info </I>directories
are located. We here at ARL use <I>/opt</I> and if no name is entered then
setup.sh will designate <I>/opt </I>as the base directory.</P>
</UL>

<P><I>Step Three: Entering the Depot directory</I></P>

<UL>
<P>After entering the software base, the administrator will be prompted
for the location of the depot directory. Depot may contain physically installed
packages and/or symbolic links to packages in the software archives. </P>

<P>For organizational purposes, the default for the depot directory is<I>
/opt/depot</I>. We have found that placing the depot directory under the
software base makes it easier to manage, but there is no requirement that
depot be a sub-directory of the software base. </P>
</UL>

<P><I>Step Four: Entering the Log directory</I></P>

<UL>
<P>An optional feature of opt_depot is to have a log file created when
opt_depot, opt_link and opt_clean are run. The output from these programs
will be printed out to files contained the the log directory.</P>

<P>Again, there is no requirement that the log directory be in any particular
location relative to the depot or software base directories. At ARL we
simply use <I>/logs/opt_depot.</I></P>
</UL>

<P><I>Step Five: Creating a sites file</I></P>

<UL>
<P>To effectively manage the depot directory, opt_link needs o know the
locations of the package archives that contain packages available for linking
into depot. This information is provided by the sites file.</P>

<P>Setup.sh will execute the modify_scripts utility contained in the opt_depot
package to create the sites file. Each entry in the file will consist of
a label, the location of the package archive, and its relative priority.
<I>There must be at least one software archive listed in the sites file
for opt_link to function properly</I>.</P>
</UL>

<P><I>Step Six: Choosing an installation directory</I></P>

<UL>
<P>The final step in the installation process is to specify the directory
where the opt_depot scripts will reside. Setup.sh will install the opt_depot
scripts in a package style format to this directory, with the executable
scripts placed under /bin, man pages placed under /man, and configuration
and uti;ity files placed under /etc. The <B>#!</B> line from step one will
be added to the scripts at this time.</P>
</UL>

<P><I>All Done</I></P>

<UL>
<P>At this point opt_depot should be able to run. The administrator may
want to consider adding a call to opt_setup to the chron table and should
create any .<A HREF="glossary.html#.exclude">exclude</A> or .<A HREF="glossary.html#priority">priority</A>
files that might be needed. </P>
</UL>
